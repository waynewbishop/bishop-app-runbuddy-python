# Run Buddy: AI-Powered Running Outfit Recommender

The [Run Buddy](https://github.com/waynewbishop/bishop-app-runbuddy-swift) recommender leverages machine learning to provide personalized athletic clothing recommendations based on current weather conditions. 

## Overview

The core of Run Buddy is a machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier) that predicts appropriate running attire categories based on temperature, humidity, wind speed and other factors. The system is designed to enhance runners' experiences by suggesting suitable clothing while integrating brand partnerships.

Key Features:
- Weather-based outfit prediction using machine learning
- JSON-based data management for model, brands, user preferences, and clothing interpretations
- Flask API for seamless integration with client applications
- Continuous model improvement through user feedback

The backend is built with Python, utilizing libraries such as **scikit-learn** for machine learning, **Flask** for API development, and **pandas** for model serialization. The system architecture includes a modular design with separate components for model management, data collection, API handling, and testing.

This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of machine learning in everyday scenarios, providing value to athletes while exploring opportunities for brand integration and personalized recommendations.

Future plans include publishing modeling data and research to Kaggle as well as Google Colab.
