    MyTestCase class contains unit tests for the RunBuddyModel class.

    This class is designed to test various functionalities of the RunBuddyModel,

    methods implemented in the model. It inherits from unittest.TestCase
    to utilize Python's built-in testing framework.

    Attributes:
        model (RunBuddyModel): An instance of RunBuddyModel to be used in tests.

    Methods:
        setUp: Method to set up the test environment before each test.
        tearDown: Method to clean up after each test.
        test_something: A placeholder test method (to be replaced with actual tests).
